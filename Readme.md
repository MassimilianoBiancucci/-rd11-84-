# OpenLearn
It's a deep learning library, written in C++, that implement classes to create, train and use neural networks on cpu and gpu with cuda, with support for Nvidia graphics cards only (tested on gpu with compute capability 3.5 and 6.0 ).
Actualy  the library implement classes and methods to work with MLPs and an incompleted draft of the tools needed to work with Hopfield networks.

# Files
In the datasets and models folders there are files with the syntax that the library uses for loading and saving such objects
